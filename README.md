In this virtual intership, I was given 2 task's.

Task 1 : Web Scraping to gain company insights

Business problem : British airways (BA) want to understand how people view BA customer experience to make our operations run more efficiently and make our customer experience even better.

For this task, I did web scraping using the beautifulsoup library on the following website: https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways

from that website, I take the information I need like customer reviews and services ratings. then I analyze the data and give me this insight :

but it's a good review or bad review? let's analyze more deeply.
